# Fashion-MNIST Classification using an MLP from scratch

The goal for this project was to build a multilayer perceptron for image classification. All model components including input, hidden, and output layers
along with backpropagation, and stochastic gradient descent with L2 regularization are implemented from in Python/CuPy. Additionally, we perform hyperparameter optimization and compare the 
accuracy of several differnet MLP architectures to a CNN. A more complete discussion can be found in `MLP_report.pdf`.
